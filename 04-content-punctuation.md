### Spacing

Leave only **one** letter space after a full stop at the end of a sentence. This rule applies to all punctuation.

### Full stops

Use full stops in contractions such as **e.g.** and **i.e.** and in abbreviations such as **M.Sc.** and **Ph.D.**

Do not use full stops:

* after people's titles, e.g. Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr; spell out Professor;
* in acronyms, e.g. WFP, ODOC;
* when the last letter of an abbreviated word is the same as that of the original word, e.g. Ltd (limited), St (Saint).

### Commas

Commas are poorly understood and often used incorrectly. The Penguin Guide to Punctuation, by R.L. Trask, includes an excellent section on commas, outlining four different types and their use. An online version of the guide is available on the website of the [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/comma). It is not very long and does not take long to read.

### Colons

The main use of the colon is to indicate that the clause following the colon is an explanation or elaboration of the clause preceding it.

**Example:**

The film was a disaster: the plot was thin, the direction aimless and the acting obvious. (The second clause explains the statement in the first.)

The colon is also used to introduce a list. 

**Example:**

The committee posed the following questions: What are the constraints on development? What will be the benefits?

The colon should not be used to introduce a list when the list flows grammatically and naturally as part of the structure of the sentence.

**Example:**

> **Correct:** The main components of an automobile engine include the cylinder block, the pistons and the cylinder head.

> **Incorrect:** The main components of an automobile engine include: the cylinder block, the pistons and the cylinder head.

An initial capital letter is used in the clause following the colon when the clause is a complete sentence.

### Semicolons

Semicolons are used to mark closely related independent clauses in a sentence. Information in the second clause is added to that in the first; it does not explain or amplify the first clause, as the colon does. Both the clause before and the clause after the semicolon must be complete sentences (that is what makes them independent clauses). Thus the semicolon used in this way may always be replaced by a period, but the semicolon signals the reader that the two clauses are closely related.

> **The delivery of rations was interrupted for two days; alternative means of transport had to be found to resume the shipments.**
{: .notice }

Compare:

**The water was as smooth as glass; the further bank was perfectly reflected in it.** (Semicolon – the second clause adds information related to the first.)
  
**The water was as smooth as glass: not a breath of wind was stirring.** (Colon – the second clause explains the first.)

Semicolons may be used to separate items in a list that are sentences or clauses (and that could be presented in a bulleted list with the items in the list set out on separate lines)..

> **The project achieved the following: it reached 160,000 beneficiaries; it stayed within budget; and it provided experience on which future activities could be based.**
{: .notice }

Semicolons separate the entries of a numbered or bulleted list:

* assess needs;
* train workers; and
* monitor progress.

### Hyphens

There is a distinction between a hyphen and an en-dash (--). Apart from the difference in length, there is a difference in purpose.

**_When to use a hyphen_**

Follow the word index in the WFP style guide, the word list in the [United Nations editorial manual](http://dd.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/ed-guidelines/style/spelling.htm) or the Online [Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/), in that order. If the word you are wondering whether to hyphenate is not there then follow the principles below.

The hyphen is used to link two words to form compounds, usually adjectives but also adverbs and nouns. There is a tendency to use the hyphen for this purpose mechanically and excessively. The [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/hyphenanddash/hyphen) again provides an excellent explanation of when – and why – to use hyphens, the thrust of which is that they should be used sparingly, when they are necessary to avoid confusion:

The hyphen is used in writing compound words which, without the hyphen, would be ambiguous, hard to read or overly long. Here, more than anywhere else in the whole field of punctuation, there is room for individual taste and judgement; nevertheless, certain principles may be identified. These are:]

* Above all, strive for clarity
* Don't use a hypen unless it's necessary
* Where possible, follow established usage.

On this last point, consult a good dictionary

In line with this advice, use a hyphen to connect two words that together function as a compound modifier (an adjective or adverb) when to do otherwise might be confusing

Example: “The short-story editor replaced the book on the shelf.” Without the hyphen one might conclude that the subject of that sentence is a story editor who happened to be short, rather than an editor of short stories as intended. If there is little likelihood of confusion omit the hyphen. Example: high school student.

Example: 100-year-old trees. This refers to an unstated number of trees that are 100 years old. Without the hyphens it could refer either to that or to 100 trees that are one year old.

No hyphen is needed with adverbs ending in –ly (e.g., a “badly written novel”. One is needed, however, when an adverb not ending in -ly might be mistaken for an adjective. For example, “a little-used car” may or may not be understood in the same way as “a little used car”.

Use hyphens to link to prefixes (e.g., post-apocalyptic) when omitting the hyphen might cause confusion. Examples: re-cover (when you mean to cover again, to avoid confusing it with recover), pre-position (when you mean to position in advance, to avoid confusing it with preposition) and un-ionized (when you mean something that has not been ionized, to avoid confusion with unionized)

Also use hyphens to link prefixes when omitting the hyphen would produce a word that is hard to read or subject to mispronunciation: non-negotiable; pre-empt; re-emerge. Note that prefixes should never stand alone: they must either form part of a closed word (e.g., antimicrobial) or be made part of a compound word through the use of a hyphen (e.g., anti-aircraft).

**Pendent hyphens.** “… two-, three- or four-year periods” is an accepted form. Avoid the construction where possible, however; “periods of two, three or four years” is clearer.

Some hyphenated and unhyphenated words (see the style guide word index for other words not listed here)

**_Unhyphenated**
* agro(compounds closed except before a vowel, e.g., agro-ecology, agroforestry)
* bi(compound forms of bi are closed: biannual, biennial, bimonthly, biweekly, etc.
* capacity building
* capacity strengthening
* co- (many compounds closed, but note co-author, co-chair, co-investor, co-worker)
* decision making
* emergency response
* extra (usually closed (e.g., extrabudgetary, extracurricular) except when extra is followed by a proper noun (extra-Community) or a vowel (extra-atmospheric))
* food assistance for assets
* food deficit country
* food insecure country
* handover
* multipurpose (generally compound forms with multi are closed, except where multi is followed by “i" (FAO follows this approach but UN headquarters spells quite a few with the hyphen, for which there is no apparent reason))
* multisectoral
* overambitious (generally compound forms with over are closed)
* private sector
* runoff
* school age (school-age as adjective)
* school meals (e.g., school meals programme)
* sub (many examples of both hyphenated and unhyphenated words)

### En-dashes

An en-dash is used to connect spans of numbers or dates (e.g. 2005--2006) and where the second word in a group does not modify the first one, as in "a WFP--FAO project". It is also used to separate an interjected phrase from the main sentence, in which case it is used with a space before and after it. As with an interjected phrase between commas, it should be possible to lift out the part of the sentence within dashes, leaving the rest of the sentence complete.

> **This donation -- the largest received so far -- will enable WFP to buy extra food.**
{: .notice }

### Parentheses and brackets

(When a complete sentence is enclosed in parentheses, its punctuation is also enclosed.)

When only part of a sentence is enclosed in parentheses, punctuation is placed outside (as in this example).

Use parentheses and brackets sparingly. Excessive use can impede readability.

(Use square brackets [if needed] within parentheses.)

### Quotation marks

Double quotation marks are used for quoting sentences, phrases or words.

As with parentheses, punctuation marks are placed inside the quotation marks only if they belong to the quotation; otherwise they are placed outside. When a full stop or other punctuation mark would apply both to the quotation and the sentence, it’s placed outside the quotation marks.

Reported speech is enclosed in double quotation marks.

Where one quotation appears within another, the inner quotation takes single quotes.

> **"When we say 'urgent', we mean the day before yesterday," said the editor.**
{: .notice }

Punctuation not referring to the quote itself falls outside the quotation marks.

> **Mr Smith was said to be "resigned to his fate".**
{: .notice }

However, where a complete sentence is quoted, it takes its own punctuation.

> **Mr Smith was said to be "resigned to his fate in the restructuring. He did not expect miracles."**
{: .notice }

When a quotation is interrupted by words such as she said, commas separate the interjected phrase.

> **"We will do it by Friday," she said, "so the deadline will be respected."**
{: .notice }

Added and omitted words in quoted text

When it is necessary to insert words into a quoted passage to make the passage function grammatically, enclose the inserted words in square brackets to indicate that they are not part of the original quotation. Conversely, you should use an ellipsis (…) to indicate that you have omitted words from a quoted passage.
