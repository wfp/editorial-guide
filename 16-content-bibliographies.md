### Published sources

All references must include: 

i) books – name of author(s) in bold, year of publication, title (italics), internet address rather than place of publication and publisher when possible; if the place of publication is a national capital, there is no need to include the name of the country;

ii) articles – author(s)(bold), year, article title (in normal font), journal title (*italic*), volume (issue no. in brackets) and pages.

Give the names of all the authors of a work. When an author has written more than one work in the same year, use a, b, etc. to differentiate, e.g. 1996a, 1996b.

Use the ampersand (&) between the names of the last two authors in the bibliography but use and in the text.

Titles of books and journals are *italicized*. Titles of articles and chapters are set in a regular font (i.e. not bold or italic). The principal words are capitalized.

Some examples of bibliography entries:

__Hobbs, J.B., Sutcliffe, H. & Hammond, W. 2005.__ The *Statistics of Emergency Aid.* Bristol, UK, University of Wessex Press.

(NB: In bibliographies "UK" and "USA" are acceptable.)

__Haines, S. & Hunter, C.__ 1996. Exocortis Virus of Citrus. *Citrus Ind.*, 49(1): 13– 17.

__McKenzie, J. & Gilbert, J.R.__ 1990. Editorial Guidelines. *In* J. Wright & L. Cole, eds. *Points of Style*, p. 123–146. Washington, DC, World Resources Institute.
