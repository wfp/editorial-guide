### Officialese

Avoid jargon, buzzwords and buzz phrases. They obscure meaning and make documents more difficult to understand and to translate.


### Excessive detail

Include only relevant detail needed to make your point. Too much information will weaken or obscure your argument.

Consider these two sentences, which say the same thing:

(i) "Food rations, including the planned quantities of fortified food commodities such as corn-soya blend (CSB) and high-energy biscuits (HEB), grain-based food items such as wheat flour, barley and rice, pulses such as beans and lentils, sugar, locally baked bread products including loaves, rolls, small pastries and traditional cakes, vegetable oil such as regionally procured olive oil and locally-produced oil pressed from sunflower seeds, and iodized and non-iodized salt were distributed fully, equitably and in a timely manner by WFP field and country office staff assisted by locally employed workers, both women and men, staff of partner and non-partner non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government counterpart staff and personnel representing selected implementing partners (IPs), to the full caseload of all refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other specific beneficiary groups, with due attention to specially targeted vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women, children under 5, disabled people, women heads of households, chronically sick or elderly people and people suffering from or affected by HIV/AIDS, and in line with the objectives of the protracted relief and recovery operation (PRRO) as agreed with government representatives from ministries such as the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Food Supply and the Ministry for the Coordination of Health, Social Welfare and Food Supply." (204 words)
(ii) "Rations were distributed." (3 words)

Sentence (i) contains all possible detail, so anything of significance is obscured in the mass of information;

Sentence (ii) contains no detail at all, so nothing of significance is conveyed to the reader.

Neither sentence makes a clear point.


### Redundant words and words to avoid

Avoid unnecessary adjectives and adverbs: they add to the length of a document and usually impede communication.

Some examples of words and expressions to avoid:

__key.__ A *key* decision is an important or significant decision; *key* personnel are essential staff. In most cases there is no need to use a qualifier at all.

__strategic.__ "Strategic" can be used to mean "affecting WFP as a whole", but do not write expressions such as "...a *strategic* policy decision...", because a decision on policy is by its nature strategic.

__due to, owing to.__ Use "because of", "caused by" or "resulting from

__above-mentioned.__ Leave out.

__activities.__ Leave out. __not__ "training *activities*", "school feeding *activities*", "advocacy *activities*" or "emergency response *activities*".

__a total of.__ Leave out. __not__ "The operation cost WFP *a total of* USD 743,200 ..."__; not__ "WFP will require a *total* of 45 trucks ...".

__better; further,__ as in "... to *better* understand..." or "... to *further* develop ...". Use "... to enhance understanding of ...", or "... to continue development of ...". Split infinitives such as the ones quoted should in any case be avoided.

__both ... and.__ "And" by itself is sufficient.

__brief(ly),__ especially with "summary". A summary is an abbreviation of a text, so "briefly" is redundant.

__careful(ly).__ Leave out. __not__ "...the rations are __carefully__ calculated on the basis of...". (They would not be calculated carelessly.)

__closely.__ To say that "WFP will work *closely* with its partners" or "... is collaborating *closely* with ..." implies that there are circumstances in which WFP could work "distantly" with them.

__concrete.__ Unnecessary. __not__ "... the department has made *concrete* proposals for developing ...".

__corporate-wide,__ as in"...a *corporate-wide* policy decision...". Any decision on policy will by its nature affect the whole organization -- and WFP is not a corporation.

__detailed (analysis)__. An analysis must by nature pay attention to detail.

__duly__, as in "... *duly* authorized ..." or "... *duly* signed ...". Unnecessary.

__effective(ly)__, as in " ... proposals for *effective* strategies to address the problem ...". Avoid. Nobody is going to propose ineffective strategies; in any case, effectiveness is determined after the event.

__efforts__, as in "... WFP will continue its advocacy *efforts* for ...". Unnecessary.

__events__, as in "... is affected by recurrent flood *events* ...". Unnecessary.

__food commodity.__ Do not use *commodity* as a synonym for "food". Use "food item(s)" if you need to specify, just as "non-food item(s)" is used. The OED defines a commodity as "... a thing that is an object of trade, *esp*. a raw material or agricultural crop".

__furthermore, in addition, moreover, similarly.__ Usually redundant.

__including,__ as in "... all beneficiaries, *including* women and children ...". Unnecessary.

__mutual (agreement).__ An agreement is by definition mutual.

__necessary,__ as in "... ensure that staff have the *necessary* skills to...". *Un*necessary.

__respective(ly)__, as in "... will report to their *respective* departments ...". Avoid constructions such as "... rose by 2.5 percent and 3.6 percent in 2004 and 2005 *respectively* ...". Use "... rose by 2.5 percent in 2004 and by 3.6 percent in 2005 ...".

__some, approximately, more than, over__, as in "... targeting approximately 600,000 beneficiaries ...". Unnecessary.

__specific,__ as in "... must give *specific* reasons ..." or "... in the *specific* event of an emergency ...". Unnecessary.

__to the extent possible__, as in "... WFP will support the project to the *extent possible* ...". If you have to qualify, be precise, as in "as long as resources are available ..." or "provided access is granted ...".


### Generic + specific

Do not use a generic term followed by examples, or an example followed by a generic term, as in "... natural disasters (flood, drought, earthquake etc.) ..." or "... in a fire or other emergency ...".

Some examples of words to avoid:

__including,__ as in "... vulnerable refugees, *including* women and children ...".

__namely__, as in "... the project will require a *number of inputs, namely* additional project staff, more training activities for partner staff and increased space in the existing offices ...".


### Metaphors

Metaphors are unlikely to convey meaning to non-native speakers of English and are not readily translatable.

Some examples of metaphors and other words/expressions to avoid:

__bolster.__ Prefer "supported", "increased", "enhanced", etc.

__bundling.__ Prefer "combining".

__dashboard__. In corporatespeak it means "a set of" or perhaps "a system of".

__framework__. Use "office", "structure", "organization", "system", "process", "plan", "table", "project", as appropriate. Exception: United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF).

__methodology__. Prefer "methods".

__prior__ to. Use "before".

__role__, as in "... WFP will play the role of facilitator ..." or "... in this operation, the role of WFP will be to ...". Prefer "WFP is to be the facilitator" or "WFP will ...".

__strengthen__. Prefer "enhance", "improve", "increase" etc. as applicable. For example "... to increase coverage ...", "... to improve understanding ...", "... to enhance its nutritive value ...".

__talk the talk/walk the walk.__ Difficult to translate.

__traffic lights__. The term means "a system to identify different states or situations"; prefer "monitoring system" or "early-warning plan" or whatever accurately conveys your meaning.

__window__, as in "window of opportunity". Commonly misused.

### Latin and Greek expressions – use the English equivalents

If you are determined to use a Latin or Greek expression, check the *[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorter_Oxford_English_Dictionary)*: some have passed into common usage and are set in roman (ad hoc), while others are italicized and may be transliterated (*inter alia*).

| AVOID | USE |
|:-----------|-------------|
| __ad hoc__ (= for this purpose)       |        as required |
| __e.g.__ *(exemplum gratis)*      |        for example; or instance |
| __i.e.__ *(id est)*       |        that is; in other words |
| __inter alia__       |        among other things (it's almost always redundant) |
| __modus operandi__       |        way of working; method of implementation |
| __post-__       |        after; subsequent |
| __vis-&agrave;-vis   |        with regard to; regarding |


### Miscellaneous

__As, since, because__ and __for__. *As* and *since* are used when the reason is already well known or is less important than the rest of the sentence; they often begin the sentence. Use *because* to avoid possible confusion with the notion of time. *Because* is generally used when the reason is the most important part of the sentence. Use it rather than as or since. *For* suggests that the reason is given as an afterthought, and its clause never comes at the beginning of the sentence. Avoid it.

__As well as.__ *As well* as means and not only; it does not mean and additionally; therefore the phrase that follows must be the most important or basic element: "The programme will accomplish A and B as well as [i.e. and not only] C." It is not a solution for adding a last item after a penultimate item containing the word *and*. Use it sparingly; *and* is usually sufficient.

__Association, group, organization.__ Don’t alternate these terms for the same entities; choose whichever is appropriate and stick to it.

__Biennial, bi-annual.__ *Biennial* clearly means "once in a biennium" or "once every two years". But DO not use the ambiguous *bi-annual*: it can be taken to mean either "twice a year" or "once every two years".

__Bi-monthly, bi-weekly.__ DO not use these ambiguous terms: bi-monthly can mean either "twice a month" or "once every two months". The same applies to bi-weekly.

__Between or among.__ Between can only be used with two factors. When you have three or more factors, use among.

__Compared with__ or __compared to__. Use *compared with* when comparing *like* things: "When compared with last year’s yield, this year’s harvest shows a 10-percent increase." Use compared to when comparing *unlike* things: “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” (Shakespeare).

__Concerned__. Putting *concerned* before the noun risks conveying the sense that the parties etc. are worried. The preferable placement is after – *the parties concerned, the countries concerned* – because the meaning is "the parties that are concerned".

__False intensifiers__. Do not use *very, particularly, extremely*, etc. with words such as *critical, crucial, decisive, fundamental, unique or usual.* Something either is crucial, unique, etc. or it is not; there’s no degree and therefore no need for intensifiers. In general, avoid intensifiers: they are subjective terms that dilute meaning.

__Fewer__ or __less__. Use *fewer* only when referring to items that are *countable*: "There are fewer people here today than there were yesterday." *Less* is used for *uncountable* quantities: "He has put less effort into this job."

__Level__. Use *the* before an adjective qualifying *level*, as in "At *the* national level", not "at national level".

__Male/Female.__ Use *men* and *women* as adjectives when referring to people, not male and female (exception: male or female members of a family or household): “household headed by women” (not “female-headed household”).

__Mobilize__. Does not mean *animate, encourage or stimulate*. It means "organize for service or action", "render movable", "bring into circulation".

__Nouns in apposition.__ The treatment depends on whether the item cited is the only one of its kind: "My sister, Barbara, has arrived" (commas before and after the noun in apposition; implies you only have one sister) or "My sister Barbara has arrived" (no commas; implies you have several sisters and the one called Barbara has arrived).

__Prepositions__. Avoid common mistakes in the use of prepositions by following these general rules:

* __assist in + gerund__ (e.g. “assist in planning”; not “assist to plan”)
* __help + infinitive__ (e.g. “help to develop”)
* __integrate into__ (not in)
* __suggest + gerund__ (e.g. “suggest using”; not “suggest to use”)
* __to target - no preposition__ (e.g. "... will target children under 5 ..."); but NB "... targeted to children under 5 ..."

__Such as, including.__ *Such as* or *including* implies that you’re listing only some of the items, so there’s no need to add etc. at the end.

__Synergy.__ *Synergy* means: “i) the interaction or cooperation of two or more drugs, agents, organizations, etc.,*to produce a new or enhanced effect compared with their separate effects;* ii) an instance of this”. Don’t use *synergistic* as a synonym for "cooperative", "interconnected" or "interrelated".
