### Footnotes

Footnotes should be brief, limited to providing references or extra information that would be out of context in the body of the text.

**_Accepted footnote styles_**

### Footnote numbering

Footnote numbers should be in superscript and attached to the word(s) or phrase to which they refer, for example:

__The programme__<sup>__7__</sup> __will run from ....__

If the word(s) or phrase is followed by punctuation, the footnote number is placed after the punctuation mark, for example:

__... at the end of the programme,__<sup>7</sup> __when ...__
