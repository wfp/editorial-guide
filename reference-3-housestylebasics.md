## Audience, Structure and Style
Remember that many of those who read documents in English are not mother-tongue users of English and that nearly all documents have to be translated into other languages. Use direct language, avoiding technical language and slang, be brief and avoid repetition. Aim for clarity, accuracy, continuity and consistency.

## Spelling and Punctuation
English (UK) is the standard spelling, with some exceptions. The most notable exception is ‘z’ rather than ‘s’, as in organization, mobilize, synthesize, realization, etc. However, analyse is spelled with an ‘s’, as are exercise, advertise, merchandise, catalyse, paralyse. Respect the name of organizations, as in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the titles of books or articles and the national spellings of organizations or programmes. (See the full-length WFP Guide, especially “Spelling and Terminology” and “List of Words Frequently Used in WFP Documents”; check the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary or their on-line “ask oxford”.)
In lists, omit the comma before the and (or the or) preceding the last item (e.g. cereals, pulses and oil) unless it is necessary to avoid ambiguity (e.g. design, monitoring and evaluation, and feedback).

## Abbreviations and Acronyms
Acronyms should be spelled out in full at their first occurrence in text.
Non-English acronyms should be spelled out in italic, followed in brackets by the English equivalent.
The only countries referred to by an acronym are the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For names of countries, adjectives of nationality and denominations of currency, consult the FAOTERM Names of Countries.
Never use acronyms for governments (e.g. the Government of Kenya, not GoK) or for names of countries (e.g. the United Kingdom, not the UK). World Bank is never abbreviated.
For dollars use USD, with a hard space before the numerals and between the numeral and million (e.g. USD 246.1 million). For the euro use EUR (e.g. EUR 356,128).
When used with a numeral, units of measurement are not written out (e.g. 2 kg, 1,200 kcal, 46 km3, 504 mt, 4 ha), except for litre.
In text, always write out percent with a hard space between the numeral and percent. In tables, use % with no space between the numeral and the symbol.
No full point after abbreviations where the contractions ends with the last letter of the word (e.g. Mr, Dr, St, Ltd).

## Hyphens
Use a hyphen to form a compound adjective (e.g. long-term effects, private-sector partnership, civil-society organization, two- or three-year period). Do not use with adjectives modified by adverbs (which usually end in –ly) (e.g. locally purchased food, environmentally sound development). [See use of en-dash under “Numbers”.]

## Numbers
Write out one through ten, but use numerals for 11 and above. Exceptions are:

* a number that begins a sentence is always written as a word;
* a number accompanying a unit, or used as a person’s age – always written as a
numeral (e.g. 8 percent, children under 5, the 6–10 age group); and
* when numbers from both groups are used together: use numerals (e.g. There were 9
men and 13 women in the group).

Millions should extend to only one decimal point (e.g. 22.1 million); two decimal places are preferred for amounts in billions. Fractions are written in words, without hyphens (e.g. one third). In text, use a comma to divide thousands (e.g. 2,468) but in tables use a hard space (e.g. 2 648).

Use an en-dash to indicate a span of numbers (e.g. 2008–2010, 4–6 June 2009). Use a slash (/) to indicate a period beginning in one calendar year and ending in another but not including the full years (e.g. the 2009/10 school year). Use numerals for decades (e.g. During the 1990s...).

## Capitalization
* For WFP only, use Member States, Board members, members of the Board (or members of the Bureau). The only United Nations job titles usually capitalized are: Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General, Executive Director, Assistant Executive Director, President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Chief, External Auditor, Inspector General, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary to the Executive Board, Regional Director and Country Director.
* Capitalize the second/third word in a (capitalized) hyphenated phrase (e.g. Inter-Agency Standing Committee).
* Capitalize Annex but not paragraph (e.g. Details on paragraph 3 may be found in Annex I-A).
* Use capital initial letters in titles of documents, publications, headings and sub-headings (as far down as Heading 4), except for articles and prepositions (e.g. Child Growth, Shocks and Food Aid in Rural Ethiopia).
* Government is capitalized when it refers to a certain government but not when it is plural or used as an adjective (e.g. The Government will provide funding; it is a government programme; the governments of the Russian Federation and Mozambique were present; the Government of Uganda responded).
* Capitalize proper names of geographical areas (e.g. South Sudan, Western Sahara, South Africa; but eastern Sudan, northern Italy, southern Africa).


## Lists and Bullet Points
When you use a bulleted or numbered list, make sure the items all follow the same structure. For example:


### Complete sentences
The project is characterized by the following features:

* It will provide a system of management and monitoring.
* It is expected to be self-financing through user fees.
* All stakeholders will participate in all aspects of system management.

### Verb phrases (each bullet point begins with a verb)
The project is characterized by features that will:

* provide a system of management and monitoring;
* self-finance the system through user fees; and
* allow all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.

### Noun phrases (each bullet point begins with a noun)
The project is characterized by the following features:

* provision of a system of management and monitoring;
* self-financing of the system through user fees; and
* participation of all stakeholders in all aspects of system management.

Lists are not punctuated if the entries are very short:

* radios
* televisions
* cameras

When entries are more complex:

* introduce the list with a colon, as here;
* use initial lowercase letters;
* end each with a semicolon;
* put and after the penultimate semicolon; and
* close the final entry with a full stop.

List countries in alphabetical order, except when the order in which they appear serves the discussion, for example when listing countries in descending order of malnutrition rates.

## Tables and Figures

A table or figure must be placed immediately after the paragraph in which it is mentioned and should have a brief, accurate title. Number tables and figures separately, each in consecutive order.

## Footnotes and References

Footnotes should be brief, limited to providing references or extra information that would interrupt the flow of the body of the text.

To cite __*WFP documents*__, use quotation marks around the full title, followed by the reference number in parentheses – e.g. “Thematic Review of Targeting in Relief Operations: Summary Report” (WFP/EB.1/2006/7-B).

References __*in the text*__ should include the author’s surname and year of publication and sometimes page numbers (e.g. McCullough, Pingali and Stamoulis, 2008; Gentilini, 2007, p. 16).


References __*in footnotes*__ should include the author/source, title and publication year. Provide internet addresses (rather than city of publication/publisher) where possible.

References to books __*in a References section*__ should include *author (surname, first initial)*, year of publication, __title__, city of publication and publisher. References for articles include author, article title, __journal title__, volume(issue number): page numbers. For more than one author, use & between names. See examples below for punctuation.

> McCullough, E., Pingali, P. & Stamoulis, K., eds. 2008. The Transformation of Agri-Food Systems: Globalization, Supply Chains and Smallholder Farmers. London, Earthscan.

> Smith, J. 1999. Feeding Children. Journal of Nutrition, 8(6): 22–23.

## Fonts

Use __*italic*__ exclusively for book titles and for words and expressions in languages other than English (which must then be explained in brackets, e.g. “Meetings were held at the __woreda__ (administrative district) level”).

Use *bold* for sub-headings except where other formatting provides the emphasis, such as in bulleted lists.

Leave only one letter space after a full stop at the end of a sentence.

## Tools of the Trade

For full details, the tools of the trade are:

* the full-length WFP Style Guide;
* FAOTERM Names of Countries (for names of countries, adjectives of
nationality and denominations of currency);
* UNTERM (for names of bodies and for terminology); and
* the latest edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary or the Concise
Oxford English Dictionary.
