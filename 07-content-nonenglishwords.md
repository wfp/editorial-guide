If necessary, briefly explain local terms in a footnote when they're first mentioned, for example "**_walo_** (low-lying land flooded during part of the year)","**_woreda_** (administrative district)".

Some __Greek and Latin__ words have passed into common usage in English â€“ but be careful with the plural forms:

* phenomenon/phenomena;
* criterion/criteria;
* genus/genera;
* datum (rare in the singular)/data;
* forum/fora;
* medium/media.
