Use capitals sparingly. Write Member State(s) of WFP, but member state(s)/country(ies) if it's another institution or undefined.

**_Job titles_**

References in text to WFP job titles such as budget officer, project director and accountant are not given as acronyms or capitalized. The following titles are capitalized: Secretary-General, Executive Director, Assistant Executive Director, Regional Director, Country Director, President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Chief, External Auditor, Chief Financial Officer.

**_Programmes, conferences, seminars, workshops_**

Once the full title is given, references to the programme, the conference, etc. are not capitalized.

**_Bodies proposed but not yet established_**

These are not capitalized. The same holds true for references to draft conventions and treaties that do not yet exist.

**_References to parts of documents_**

Do not capitalize *paragraph*, e.g. "In paragraph 12, reference is made to ...". However, *Annex* is capitalized, e.g. "See Annex IV". Annexes should be numbered in roman capital numerals I, II, III, etc.

**_Titles of documents and publications_**

The titles of **documents** are set in roman in quotation marks, with capital initial letters except for articles and prepositions.

> **Committee members will need a copy of "Joint Evaluation Report on the Business Process Review" for reference.**
{: .notice }

For **publications**, use capitals for the initial letters except for articles and prepositions, and set the title in *italics*.

> Committee members will need copies of **Eradicating Swine Fever: a Field Manual for Practitioners** at the meeting.
{: .notice }

**_Government names_**

Government is capitalized when it refers to a certain government but not when it is plural or used as an adjective:
* the Government will provide funding; 
* it is a government programme; 
* the governments of the Russian Federation and Mozambique were present; and
* the Government of Uganda responded.

Words such as *committee* and *commission* take a capital letter only when used as part of a proper name. The word *Secretariat* takes a capital letter when referring to WFP.

Do not use acronyms to refer to governments or ministries.
