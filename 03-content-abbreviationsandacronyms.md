Keep the use of acronyms to a minimum, and use them only where they make documents more readable.

Acronyms should be spelled out in full at their first occurrence. A list of acronyms may be set out at the end of a document in which acronyms are used. The longer the document and the more acronyms used the more this may be considered necessary.

If a name or phrase appears in a document only a few times do not use an acronym to represent it; write it in full the first time and for subsequent occurrences again write it in full or use an abbreviated version if there is no risk of confusion.

No acronyms should be used in the executive summaries of Executive Board documents, except for WFP and HIV/AIDS.

Use the form **email(s)**, lowercase (unless the term is the first word in a sentence).

When referring to US dollars use **USD** with a hard space between the letters and the number and between the numerals and the word “million” – e.g. **USD 43.2 million**. For the Euro use **EUR**. 

Do not use acronyms to refer to country names. For doubts about country names, refer to the FAOTERM names of countries and territories [website] (http://termportal.fao.org/faonocs/appl/) and [UNTERM](https://unterm.un.org/UNTERM/portal/welcome).

Never use acronyms for governments – e.g. the Government of Pakistan, not “GOP” – or ministries – e.g. the Ministry of Agriculture, not “MOA” – or the names of countries – e.g. United Kingdom, not “UK”. World Bank is never abbreviated.

The [United Nations Editorial Manual](http://dd.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/ed-guidelines/style/abbreviations.htm#Principal) has a list of accepted acronyms, primarily for United Nations and other international entities.

Never use acronyms to refer to people or staff positions – e.g. Country Director, not “CD”.

Omit the article before acronyms used as nouns – e.g. FAO, not “the FAO”, but use it with initialisms, i.e., acronyms that are pronounced letter by letter such as “the FBI”. 

Acronyms do not have full stops – e.g. **WFP**, not W.F.P.
