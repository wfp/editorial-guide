Keep the use of abbreviations and acronyms to a minimum, and use them only where they make documents more readable.

Acronyms should be spelled out in full at their first occurrence in text. A list of acronyms may be set out at the end of a document in which acronyms are used. 

If a name or phrase appears in a document only a few times do not use an acronym to represent it; write it in full the first time and for subseqent occurences again write it in full or use an abbreviated version if there is no risk of confusion.

No acronyms should be used in the executive summaries of Executive Board documents, except for WFP and HIV/AIDS.

Use the form **email(s)**, lowercase (unless the term is the first word in a sentence).

When referring to US dollars use **USD** with a hard space between the letters and the number and between the numerals and the word "million" – e.g. **USD 43.2 million**. For the Euro use **EUR**.

Do not use acronyms to refer to country names. For doubts about country names, refer to the FAOTERM names of countries and [territories website](http://termportal.fao.org/faonocs/appl/) and UNTERM.

Never use acronyms for governments – e.g. the Government of Pakistan, not "GOP" – or ministries – e.g. the Ministry of Agriculture, not "MOA" – or the names of countries – e.g. United Kingdom, not "UK". World Bank is never abbreviated.

Never use acronyms to refer to people or staff positions – e.g. Country Director, not "CD".

Omit the article before acronyms used as nouns – e.g. FAO, not “the FAO”, but use it with initialisms, i.e., acronyms that are pronounced letter by letter such as “the FBI”. Acronyms do not have full stops – e.g. WFP, not W.F.P..

Non-English acronyms should be spelled out on first use in the same way as other acronyms but in italics, followed in brackets by the acronym and its English equivalent or a translation in roman type. In the acronym list, give the full name in the original language in italics, with the English equivalent or a translation in roman type. For example:

Text:
__The operation is supported by *Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers* (SNV, Netherlands Development Organization) and local organizations.__

Acronym list entry:
**SNV *Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers* (Netherlands Development Organization)**
