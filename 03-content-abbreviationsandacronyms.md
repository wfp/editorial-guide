Keep the use of abbreviations and acronyms to a minimum.

Acronyms should be spelt out in full at their first occurrence in text. A list of acronyms must be attached to documents in which acronyms are used. 

If a name appears in the text only once, write it in full.

No acronyms should be used in the executive summaries of Executive Board documents, except for WFP and HIV/AIDS.

Use the form **email(s)**, lowercase (unless the term is the first word in a sentence).

When referring to US dollars use **USD** with a hard space between the letters and the number and between the numerals and the word "million" – e.g. **USD 43.2 million**. For the Euro use **EUR**.

The only countries referred to by an acronym are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For doubts about country names, refer to the online [FAOTERM List of Countries](http://termportal.fao.org/faonocs/appl/).

Never use acronyms for governments – e.g. the Government of Pakistan, not "GOP" – or ministries – e.g. the Ministry of Agriculture, not "MOA" – or the names of countries – e.g. United Kingdom, not "UK". World Bank is never abbreviated.

Never use acronyms to refer to people or staff positions – e.g. Country Director, not "CD".

Omit the article before acronyms used as nouns – e.g. FAO, not "the FAO". Acronyms do not have full stops – e.g. **WFP**, not W.F.P.

Non-English acronyms should be spelled out on first use in text in the same way as other acronyms but in italic, followed in brackets by the acronym and its English equivalent or a translation in roman type. In the acronym list, give the full name in the original language in italics, with the English equivalent or a translation in roman type. For example:

Text:
__The operation is supported by *Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers* (SNV, Netherlands Development Organization) and local organizations.__

Acronym list entry:
**SNV *Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers* (Netherlands Development Organization)**
