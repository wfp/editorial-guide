Ensure that the default language for your document is set to **English (UK)**. The present style guide includes a [“word index”] (http://cdn.wfp.org/guides/editorial/reference/wordindex/) that shows WFP spelling of selected words. The United Nations Editorial Manual also includes a [word list] (http://dd.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/ed-guidelines/style/spelling.htm).

Follow the WFP list; if a word is not there check the Editorial Manual list; if it’s not there follow the first spelling in the online edition of the [Oxford English Dictionary] (www.oed.com) [and] (https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/) Follow an organization’s spelling of its own name, e.g., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

### Z versus S

Use **z** (not s) in such words as reali**z**e, organi**z**ation and mobili**z**ation.

Use **s** in words such as analy**s**e, cataly**s**e and paraly**s**e.


### Names of countries

For names of countries, adjectives of nationality and denominations of currency, consult the FAOTERM “Names of Countries and territories” [webpage] (http://termportal.fao.org/faonocs/appl/) and UNTERM.

Note that some short names include the definite article. Examples include the Gambia, the Niger and the Sudan.

Note that the short names of some countries differ from the way that people commonly refer to those countries: Plurinational State of Bolivia, State of Palestine, Syrian Arab Republic, United Republic of Tanzania, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

When listing countries, in both narrative text and in lists, list them in alphabetical order except when there is a logical reason to do otherwise, for example when listing countries in descending order of malnutrition rates.

Note that, as indicated in the following table, the presentation of a few country names in narrative text differs from the presentation of those names in lists and that their placement for purposes of English alphabetical order is in both cases determined by the latter.

The short names United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America must be set out in full (i.e., as written here) the first time they appear in a document but thereafter may be presented in the abbreviated forms United Kingdom and United States. The abbreviated forms may also be used in tables if necessary, without using the full short form first
