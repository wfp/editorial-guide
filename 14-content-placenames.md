### Geographical terms

Check the names of countries, towns, etc. on the internet or consult [FAOTERM Names of Countries](http://termportal.fao.org/faonocs/appl/). [UNTERM](http://untermportal.un.org/) may also be helpful.  
(Please also see the subsection on Names of countries in the Spelling section of this guide.)

Use e.g. "the north" (noun and direction) and "northern" (adjective).

When a foreign term forms part of a geographic name in English, the meaning of the foreign term should be observed:

* **Rio Grande (not Rio Grande River)**
* **Mauna Loa (not Mount Mauna Loa)**

The only countries referred to by an acronym are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

### Political divisions

Words such as *empire, state, country, city, kingdom, colony and territory* are capitalized only when used as part of a proper name. For example:

* **Bie Province, but "the province"**
* **Kweneng District, but "the district"**
* **Roman Empire, but "the empire"**
* **Washington State, but "the state"**
