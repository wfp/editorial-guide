### Geographical terms

Check the names of countries, towns, etc. on the internet or consult [FAOTERM Names of Countries](http://termportal.fao.org/faonocs/appl/). [UNTERM](http://untermportal.un.org/) may also be helpful.

Use e.g. "the north" (noun and direction) and "northern" (adjective).

When a foreign term forms part of a geographic name in English, the meaning of the foreign term should be observed:

* **Rio Grande (not Rio Grande River)**
* **Mauna Loa (not Mount Mauna Loa)**

The only countries referred to by an acronym are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

### Political divisions

Words such as *empire, state, country, city, kingdom, colony and territory* are capitalized only when used as part of a proper name. For example:

* **Bie Province, but "the province"**
* **Kweneng District, but "the district"**
* **Roman Empire, but "the empire"**
* **Washington State, but "the state"**
