### Title page

The title page should show:

* the name of the World Food Programme in full, place of publication and year of publication 
* main title 
* subsidiary title (if applicable) 
* author(s’) names; abbreviated address if required 
* name of series (if applicable). 

### Copyright page 

The copyright page is page ii (verso of title page). The copyright page should include: 

* the standard disclaimer and any other required disclaimer 
* the WFP copyright notice: the copyright symbol © with publisher’s name and date of publication (e.g. © WFP [date])
* the reprint notice where necessary. 

### Contents

The contents list always starts on a right-hand page. It should be page iii when it follows the copyright page (no printed page number). The list should include all the preliminary material except the title and copyright page and also all end matter such as endnotes, bibliography/ reference list, glossary and index. 

### Acknowledgements

Attribution of contributions to the work, or to specific parts of it, may be included in the acknowledgements. Credits for photographs are not included in the acknowledgements (see Photographs). 

### Page numbering

The main text always starts on a right-hand page and from this point the rest of the book is paginated in Arabic numerals beginning with page 1.

### Numbers are not printed on the following pages:

* part titles
* blank pages
* pages with a full-bleed illustration.

Note that although no number is printed on these pages, they are included in calculating the page numbering.

### Photographs

Photographs should always carry a credit line adjacent to the photograph, stating the photographer’s name or, where the source is WFP, worded as follows: 

> WFP/photographer’s name, e.g. WFP/Rein Skullerud.

### Tables, figures and boxes

Tables, figures and boxes are usually numbered consecutively throughout a publication. If necessary, the numbering may be arranged by a chapter (e.g. in Chapter 9, they might be numbered Figures 9.1, 9.2, etc.). Captions should be as concise as possible.

All tables, figures and boxes should be positioned as soon as possible after the first text reference (e.g. see **Figure 1**). Where relevant, sources for any data used to compile tables and figures should be acknowledged.

### Appendices 

Material that is not essential to the main text but that is useful to the reader for further clarification may be placed in an appendix. An appendix is not where you place landscape or large tables or figures. These should still be included in the main text at the nearest possible point after the reference in the text. 

* Appendix 1 generally starts on a right-hand page. 
* When there is more than one appendix in a publication, they should be numbered Appendix 1, Appendix 2, etc. and each should also be given a title. 
* Appendices usually precede any notes and bibliography. An appendix may be placed at the end of a chapter if it is essential to understanding the chapter. 

### Notes

The notes follow any appendices and precede the bibliography. They should be arranged by chapter or by part. 

### Glossary

A glossary is an explanation of commonly used terms. It is not essential but can be useful in a publication containing many foreign or technical terms. Glossary entries should be arranged in alphabetical order. A glossary precedes a bibliography. 

### Reference list/Bibliography

A reference list contains only those works that are referred to in the text. When additional reading material is suggested, it becomes a bibliography. 

### Index

The inclusion of an index is optional. It should start on a right-hand page.
